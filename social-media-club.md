Alongside
[**Patty Huntington** (Frockwriter)][1], [**Matthew Gain** (Edelman)][2] and
[**Karla Courtney** (Tiny Times)][3] I was yesterday part of a panel hosted by
**Social Media Club Sydney** discussing the commercialisation of
the blogosphere. Some of the stuff I said was picked up.

In [**Mumbrella**][4], I was quoted welcoming a law to ensure that bloggers
declare payments or gifts they receive from brands â€“ if that same law was then
simultaneously reinforced upon all types of media in all channels. Influential
bloggers will receive some gifts and the occasional free macaroon though
compared to those freebies the average traditional media employee is best
described as an ancient Roman emperor; carried around in a golden chair and
fed with grapes. I've worked my entire career within traditional media and
that's been a very comfortable life. Feel free to have a legislation wrestle
with the blogosphere but only if all of media is gathered into the ring.

On the [**Telstra Business Blog**][5] I was quoted as saying "I've never met
a successful blogger that actually set out to be a successful blogger".
[**Gavin Heaton** on **Servant of chaos** gathered tweets, mentions and
comments through **Storify**][6] and so did [**Gloria Tiphereth**][7].

**Sydney Stockholm**'s visionary ambition is to help people become publishers.
The assistance we provide can vary from being technologically, editorially or
commercially driven but we always bet on the individual. Being a part of events
such as the **Social Media Club Sydney** we get to explain our beliefs and
hopefully through that create a more mature market overall.
