Alongside
[__Patty Huntington__ (Frockwriter)][1], [__Matthew Gain__ (Edelman)][2] and
[__Karla Courtney__ (Tiny Times)][3] I was yesterday part of a panel hosted by
__Social Media Club Sydney__ discussing the commercialisation of
the blogosphere. Some of the stuff I said was picked up.

In [__Mumbrella__][4], I was quoted welcoming a law to ensure that bloggers
declare payments or gifts they receive from brands – if that same law was then
simultaneously reinforced upon all types of media in all channels. Influential
bloggers will receive some gifts and the occasional free macaroon though
compared to those freebies the average traditional media employee is best
described as an ancient Roman emperor; carried around in a golden chair and
fed with grapes. I've worked my entire career within traditional media and
that's been a very comfortable life. Feel free to have a legislation wrestle
with the blogosphere but only if all of media is gathered into the ring.

On the [__Telstra Business Blog__][5] I was quoted as saying “I've never met
a successful blogger that actually set out to be a successful blogger”.
[__Gavin Heaton__ on __Servant of chaos__ gathered tweets, mentions and
comments through __Storify__][6] and so did [__Gloria Tiphereth__][7].

__Sydney Stockholm__'s visionary ambition is to help people become publishers.
The assistance we provide can vary from being technologically, editorially or
commercially driven but we always bet on the individual. Being a part of events
such as the __Social Media Club Sydney__ we get to explain our beliefs and
hopefully through that create a more mature market overall.
