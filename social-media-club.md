Alongside [__Patty Huntington__ (Frockwriter)](http://frockwriter.com/ "Frockwriter"), [__Matthew Gain__ (Edelman)](https://twitter.com/matthewgain/ "Matthew Gain") and [__Karla Courtney__ (Tiny Times)](http://tinytimes.com// "Tiny Times") I was yesterday part of a panel hosted by __Social Media Club Sydney__ discussing the commercialisation of the blogosphere. Some of the stuff I said was picked up.

In [__Mumbrella__](http://mumbrella.com.au/call-for-law-forcing-bloggers-and-journos-to-disclose-payments-and-gifts-120782 "Mumbrella"),  I was quoted welcoming a law to ensure that bloggers declare payments or gifts they receive from brands – if that same law was then simultaneously reinforced upon all types of media in all channels. Influential bloggers will receive some gifts and the occasional free macaroon though compared to those freebies the average traditional media employee is best described as an ancient Roman emperor; carried around in a golden chair and fed with grapes. I’ve worked my entire career within traditional media and that’s been a very comfortable life. Feel free to have a legislation wrestle with the blogosphere but only if all of media is gathered into the ring.

On the [__Telstra Business Blog__](http://smarter.telstrabusiness.com/can-you-make-money-from-a-blog.htm "Telstra Business Blog") I was quoted as saying “I’ve never met a successful blogger that actually set out to be a successful blogger”. [__Gavin Heaton__ on __Servant of chaos__ gathered tweets, mentions and comments through __Storify__](http://www.servantofchaos.com/2012/10/blog-monetisation-at-social-media-club-sydney.html "Gavin Heaton") and so did [__Gloria Tiphereth__](http://storify.com/tiphereth/the-new-age-of-blog-monetisation?awesm=sfy.co_oASN&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&utm_source=t.co&utm_content=storify-pingback&utm_campaign= "Gloria Tiphereth").

__Sydney Stockholm__'s visionary ambition is to help people become publishers. The assistance we provide can vary from being technologically, editorially or commercially driven but we always bet on the individual. Being a part of events such as the __Social Media Club Sydney__ we get to explain our beliefs and hopefully through that create a more mature market overall.
