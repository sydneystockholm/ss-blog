FELLT is approaching its first birthday. Moving into 2013 we look back at 12
months that sometimes felt like 12 years, sometimes 12 minutes. We’ve been
working hard and we’ve had a blast.

We set out to change blogging in Australia and we did. We had the ambition to
change how people look at bloggers; demanding more respect for what we believe
to be the most influential form of media – the personal one. We had the ambition
to create an economy that gave hard working individuals the pay they deserve.
We had the ambition to create a company and a fellowship that successfully
merged media and technology; a digital publisher that grew personal influence,
flourished with facts and offered not vague fluff to advertisers but actual
action, a company that could compete on the highest international level. We did
all that.

We travelled to the fashion weeks around the world and we had more individuals
covering the international fashion weeks than any other Australian media
platform. We created ad campaigns together with partners such as Chanel and
Net-a-porter, with Nokia we created a special site during New York Fashion Week
that live-streamed all of our activity from all of our phones and social media
platforms – a new way to present content. Together with Nike we gathered 4,000
female runners to run a Sydney race in favor of a safer work out environment in
the city. We did a lot. Next year, we’ll do even more.

During 2013 FELLT will grow. By focusing even more on a smaller selected group
of individuals we’ll increase the individual reach, we’ll create larger
long-term commercial relationships, and we’ll align ourselves with geographical
partners in New York, San Francisco, Stockholm and Hong Kong. Within the
company we’ve got 20 years of combined experience from all leading international
publishing platforms, some of the largest traditional media publishers in the
world and some of the most prestigious magazines. We have created our own
in-house publishing platform, advertising platform, and analytics platform.
We make it easier for large brands to invest in professional self-publishers
and we make it easier for professional self-publishers to get invested in.
