At Sydney Stockholm, we try to stick with **Dieter Ram's**
[10 Principles of design][1]. Most often, we find ourselves removing design
elements such as gradients or borders rather than adding them. As a publisher,
the most important thing we have is content. The styling should make it easier
to consume, not just look better. In fact, we spent so much time working with
content that we neglected our own website.

A few months ago we decided to do something about it. A few design iterations
later we pushed the new site live. While at it, we also spent some time refining
our branding. We maintain and develop branding for not just our own products -
but also some of the talent we work with.

While building the website, we used our own technology stack; Our publishing
platform for content (which we internally refer to as `Vialoux`), our asset
optimisation product [Pageload][3] for managing and optimising images (as well as
stylesheets) and finally a whole lot of javascript (such as [blog.md][4]) we've
come to open source as we've continuously developed our platform.

Needless to say, we're very happy about the result. There's something refreshing
(and motivating) about - as they say - [eating your own dog food][2]. It didn't
stop there though. Some of the best attributes about this thing we refer to as
"the Internet" is that quality tends to be appreciated. Since its launch, we've
been featured in multiple sites that showcases, judges or inspires. We're
extremely thankful for all words said (including were we fall short) and have
since improved the website on multiple occasions. Here's a few: [Awwwards][5],
[Typewolf][6], [Siteinspire][7], [爱果果][8], [Specky boy design magazine][9],
[Abduzeedo][10] and [CSS Author][11].

If you're interested in knowing more about how we work, what we create or
perhaps help us improve the software we use, either contact us [here][12] or
