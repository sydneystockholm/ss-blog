__FELLT__, Australia’s leading fashion blog network, continues to recruit.
After having welcomed journalists [Patty Huntington][frockwriter] and
[Mitchell Oakley Smith][mroakleysmith], this week FELLT welcomes Australian
photography superstar __Sonny Vandevelde__.

Sonny Vandevelde is considered a backstage photography icon. He shoots all the
major fashion shows around the globe (Sonny was the only photographer allowed
backstage at __Chanel__ last season) and his images regularly appear in titles
such as __The New York Times__, __V Magazine__, __Grazia__, __Vogue__ and
__Harper's Bazaar__.

Sonny’s joyful and energetic style has always attracted brands with an ambition
to produce advertising campaigns with a twist, such as __Quicksilver__,
__Coca Cola__, __Levi’s__ and __Mobistar__. International campaign production
remains a focus area for Sonny and the blog will also, parallel to the backstage
content, feature his life and work in this environment of big egos.

> "I'm thrilled to be joining FELLT," says Sonny Vandevelde.
> "I've been in this business for ages and I've been waiting for someone to
> create a professional and high-quality-platform like FELLT. It suits me
> perfectly; it's Australian and international at once and the team have
> proved themselves by launching digital partnerships with the likes of AMEX,
> Swarovski, Nike, Nokia, MARCS and Net-a-porter."

> "Sonny brings something new to FELLT," says Daniel Kjellsson, co-founder of
> digital publisher Sydney Stockholm. "We've always covered the front of
> fashion and with Sonny's unique access we are now also able to show people
> what's going on backstage. If it wasn’t for Sonny, the average reader and
> journalist wouldn’t get to experience such a closed environment."

Sonny Vandevelde's blog on FELLT is now live on [fellt.com/sonny][sonny].

FELLT was launched in April 2012 and rapidly became Australia’s leading fashion
blog network reaching 400K unique visitors each month, generating 1.6M
pageviews. FELLT is developed, owned and operated by Sydney‐based digital
publisher __Sydney Stockholm__.

Digital publisher Sydney Stockholm is one of the most talked‐about Australian
startups of recent years; disrupting traditional media with fashion network
FELLT, food network [Servved][servved] and advertising conglomerate
__The Ad Netwrk__.
