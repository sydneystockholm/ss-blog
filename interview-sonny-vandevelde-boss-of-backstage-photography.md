When it comes to backstage photography, no one quite compares to FELLT’s
[**Sonny Vandevelde**][1]. His intimate coverage of fashion weeks around the
globe give unparalleled access to an environment that is rarely seen by even
industry professionals. His images regularly appear in titles such as **Vogue**,
**Grazia**, **Harper’s Bazaar**, **V Magazine** and **The New York Times**.

Sonny is currently in Paris and we got the chance to question him about his
life on the road.

_What is your schedule like during the fashion week season? What cities,_
_in what order, do you visit on this January - February tour?_

It starts with Milan Men on the 10th January. Then onto Paris Men,
followed straight by the Haute Couture shows with **Atelier Versace** opening
on the evening of the 19th January. Then I get two days of rest (which is mostly
catching up with emails and booking hotels), and then fly to Stockholm
Fashion Week. Three more days of rest, then off to New York for the
Ready-to-wear shows. Then I fly back over the Atlantic and go to Milan then
lastly Paris again. So, all up, I’m gone for about eight weeks.

_How many different flights do you take?_

Off the top of my head, about fourteen.

_And how many photographs, in total, do you think you shoot?_
For men, it is about 5000-7000 in about 4-5 days. Women is easily triple that.

_Do you have a hotel room routine?_

Yes I do. In Milan I keep using the same hotel, because it’s cheap, central,
but most importantly they have fast internet for all my uploading.
In New York the **Tribeca Grand** has become my US home. In Stockholm it’s
always the **Berns Hotel** and in Paris I have been renting the same
apartment for years.

_What show usually has the most chaotic backstage environment?_

There are so many to choose from. Pretty much all of them are chaotic.
How about we choose the most calm one instead - **Lanvin**.

_Describe a normal day shooting backstage_

My day starts with a 6am wake-up to check my emails and finish what I was doing
the night before. Usually I have fallen asleep on my keyboard. In a nutshell
though, on a good day, I will be on my feet for 12 hours, and then the
computer for 6. This leaves very little time for sleep,
so those few days off in Paris and Stockholm are a lifesaver.
