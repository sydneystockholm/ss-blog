> short space of time, securing some unprecedented opportunities for its stable
> of bloggers as well as a number of highly prestigious advertising clients
> such as **Chanel**, **Net­‐A­‐Porter** and **Gucci** – campaigns that would
> normally be considered the exclusive domain of far bigger and better­‐
> established media outlets."

FELLT was launched in April 2012 and rapidly became Australia’s leading fashion
blog network reaching 400K unique visitors generating 1.6M pageviews per month.

Digital publisher Sydney Stockholm is one of the most talked‐about Australian
start­‐ups of recent years, disrupting traditional media with fashion blog
network FELLT and food blog network [Servved][3].
