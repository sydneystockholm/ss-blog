Global-roaming journalist, editor and author Mitchell Oakley Smith is joining
Australian blog network [FELLT][fellt]. Oakley Smith has previously held
senior roles at Australian GQ and GQ Style. He has also written for
Architectural Digest, Harper's Bazaar, The Australian and Vogue Australia.
He is the author of three books on art, fashion and design.

Mitchell Oakley Smith's blog on FELLT, named "Mr Oakley Smith", will focus on
male fashion and is the first step into male fashion journalism
for the blog network.

> "As a traditional print journalist, I personally thought it was time for me
> to move into the digital sphere in a serious, considered way", says Mitchell
> Oakley Smith. "Coming from a professional background in established titles
> and companies, FELLT was an obvious choice as a launch
> platform for this blog."

FELLT was launched in April 2012 and rapidly became Australia’s leading fashion
blog network reaching 400K unique visitors each month, generating 1.6M
pageviews. FELLT is developed, owned and operated by Sydney‐based digital
publisher Sydney Stockholm.

> "We are thrilled to be working with Mitchell Oakley Smith", says Daniel
> Kjellsson, co-founder of Sydney Stockholm. "Prior to launching Mr Oakley Smith
> our entire focus was on female fashion, but considering that many of our
> current advertisers also have male offerings, it's only natural that
> we do too. It has become a signature for Sydney Stockholm as a publisher and
> FELLT as a blog platform to only feature the giants; the true
> high-quality authorities. Mitchell Oakley Smith is just that."

> "MrOakleySmith.com provides a platform for long-form journalism - features,
> reviews, profiles and opinion pieces - across the fields of fashion, art,
> culture and design", says Mitchell Oakley Smith. "As a journalist, editor and
> author working in all areas of the visual landscape, I feel uniquely placed to
> offer readers a broad cross-section of interesting writing."

Digital publisher Sydney Stockholm is one of the most talked‐about Australian
start­ups of recent years; disrupting traditional media with fashion network
FELLT, food network [Servved][servved] and advertising conglomerate
The Ad Netwrk.

Mitchell Oakley Smith also edits and publishes quarterly men's fashion journal
Manuscript. His third book, Art &amp; Fashion in the 21st Century, co-authored
with art curator Alison Kubler, is due for release in October.
